# This file was produced by bcftools stats (1.21+htslib-1.21) and can be plotted using plot-vcfstats.
# The command line was:	bcftools stats  /home/pezy/tmp/petagenome_pipeline/modules/test/idx.vcf

# Definition of sets:
# ID	[2]id	[3]tab-separated file names
ID	0	/home/pezy/tmp/petagenome_pipeline/modules/test/idx.vcf
# SN, Summary numbers:
#   number of records   .. number of data rows in the VCF
#   number of no-ALTs   .. reference-only sites, ALT is either "." or identical to REF
#   number of SNPs      .. number of rows with a SNP
#   number of MNPs      .. number of rows with a MNP, such as CC>TT
#   number of indels    .. number of rows with an indel
#   number of others    .. number of rows with other type, for example a symbolic allele or
#                          a complex substitution, such as ACT>TCGA
#   number of multiallelic sites     .. number of rows with multiple alternate alleles
#   number of multiallelic SNP sites .. number of rows with multiple alternate alleles, all SNPs
# 
#   Note that rows containing multiple types will be counted multiple times, in each
#   counter. For example, a row with a SNP and an indel increments both the SNP and
#   the indel counter.
